# Making Web Accessibility Sexy

*Disclaimer*: There is no replacement for designing for accessibility in the first place.
This tip is a hack, and not guaranteed to always work. It's also dependent on the user's web
browser supporting CSS filters.

---

So... I was sitting there, trying to think of an appropriate way to illustrate to the user that
a specific HTML element had focus.

The default browser styles give the element in question an outline, which works well as it is
a relatively uncommon selector which is visible for both block and inline elements.

*Chrome:*  
![](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14371/focus-highlight-chrome.png)

*Firefox:*  
![](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14369/focus-highlight-chrome.png)

But for more arty projects or design centric companies, these are considered unattractive.
And as the vast majority of users don't realise that these outlines have an actual purpose,
they will think it's just ugly design.

So the aim is to come up with an alternative that is arguably less ugly, has some element of
context to the element it is referring to, and won't clash with other styles. After all,
it ought to be easily visible, as that is it's purpose.

(For the record, this article by David Gilbertson gives a JS way of ensuring styles are only
visible if you're actually using tabs for navigation: https://hackernoon.com/removing-that-ugly-focus-ring-and-keeping-it-too-6c8727fefcd2)

## Previous attempts

Whenever you change the default `:focus` styles, you may run into problems of another selector
with a higher specificity overriding the styles. For instance, if your focused element already
has a box shadow from class or id selector styles, then the focus may not appear at all, which would
be a big accessibility and usability no-no.

Putting `!important` on the `:focus` property values may fix the issue but will probably end up causing
others.

### Default styles

<style>
  #example-a {
    outline-width: 2px;
    outline-style: solid;
    outline-color: Highlight;
  }
  @media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) {
    #example-a {
      outline: -webkit-focus-ring-color auto 5px;
    }
  }
</style>

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-a">Focused</span>

```
/* no style declaration */
```

### Browser normalised `outline`

Most reliable and consistent, but arguably most ugly.

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-b">Focused</span>

<style>
  #example-b {
    outline: 2px solid #3a99fc;
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #3a99fc;
}
```

### Browser normalised `box-shadow`

As ugly as the chrome focus, but consistent cross-browser. Can run into problems
with focused elements that already have a `box-shadow`.

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-c">Focused</span>

<style>
  #example-c {
    outline: 0;
    box-shadow: 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc inset;
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc inset;
}
```

### Use a `background-color`

When used with block elements, this can look quite good. But many focusable
elements already have a `background`, which means some TLC is required, and it
is probably not worth it for the end result.

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-d">Focused</span>

<style>
  #example-d {
    outline: 0;
    background-color: rgba(58, 153, 252, .3);
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  background-color: rgba(58, 153, 252, .3);
}
```

### Opaque `background-color` with 4 `box-shadow`s (highlighter style)

Similar issues as previous, except (1) it looks better, (2) it will at the very least be
visible in the majority of cases where either a `background` or a `box-shadow` is not already
given to the element, and (3) it might be difficult to find an opaque colour that pairs with
every possible adjacent colour.

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-e">Focused</span>

<style>
  #example-e {
    outline: 0;
    background-color: rgba(158, 203, 253);
    box-shadow: -3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253), -3px 3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253), 3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253), 3px 3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253);
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  box-shadow:
    -3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
    -3px  3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
     3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
     3px  3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253);
}
```

### Translucent pseudo-element overlay

Avoids most of the clashes, and looks great with block elements.
Whereas changing the background color of an element might cause non transparent images inside
to look awkward, this will overlay them.

Definitely my favourite appearance-wise, and the Google Play Music app which is very tab-key
friendly uses it for the play button, next-song button and so on.

Key issues:
- Reduces contrast, potentially making it a problem for the visually impaired.
- Clashes with anything with the same (before/after) pseudo element.
- Does not work for any tags that cannot contain pseudo elements, which is a lot of them,
  including many form inputs, and img tags.
- Adding `position: relative` to an element can have some wild side effects.

<span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-f">Focused</span>

<style>
  #example-f {
    position: relative;
  }

  #example-f::before {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 9999;
    pointer-events: none;
    top: -3px;
    left: -3px;
    right: -3px;
    bottom: -3px;
    background-color: rgba(158, 203, 253, .4);
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  position: relative;
  outline: 0;
}

:focus::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 9999;
  pointer-events: none;
  top: -3px;
  left: -3px;
  right: -3px;
  bottom: -3px;
  background-color: rgba(158, 203, 253, .4);
}
```

## My current method - `filter: drop-shadow`

---

<span class="text-a"><span>Unfocused</span> &rarr; <span id="example-g">Focused</span></span>

---

It's a shadow. It looks a bit strange, but:
- It works with block and inline elements, as well as wrapping text
- The drop shadow has context of the element
  (the colour of the shadow is the element's `color` and the size of the shadow is relative to the element's `font-size`)
- It rarely clashes with anything as filters are so rarely used on focusable elements.
- It looks at transparency and border radii to generate the shadow.
- You can customise how the shadow looks on block elements by changing the block element's `color` and `font-size`,
  which does not affect the block element's appearance itself, and the effects on the descendants can be overridden
  by the children.

### Examples

#### Effect relative to font-size

<span class="text-a">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-a" id="example-g">Focused</span><br>
<span class="text-b">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-b" id="example-g">Focused</span><br>
<span class="text-c">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-c" id="example-g">Focused</span>

#### Effect shares font color

<span class="text-d">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-d" id="example-g">Focused</span><br>
<span class="text-e">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-e" id="example-g">Focused</span><br>
<span class="text-f">Unfocused &rarr; </span><span class="text-f" id="example-g">Focused</span>

<div class="button-a">Unfocused</div> &rarr; <div class="button-a" id="example-g">Focused</div>

<style>
  .text-a {}
  .text-b { font-size: 30px; }
  .text-c { font-size: 40px; }
  .text-d { color: red; }
  .text-e { color: blue; }
  .text-f { color: green; }
  .button-a {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #ccc;
    padding: 4px 12px;
    border-radius: 9999px;
  }

  #example-g {
    outline: 0;
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.2ex);
  }
</style>

```
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.2ex);
}
```

That's all folks! I'm off for a sandwich.
